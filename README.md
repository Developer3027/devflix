# Devflix

### Welcome to the Devflix repo.

This project is to provide the service of organizing YouTube videos to focus on web development and cut out the noise, allowing web devs to focus on learning new skills, sharpening their current skill stack, and readily get to the resources the providers want you to have.

YouTube is a valuable resource and content providers pour their heart and soles into teaching us important skill sets to improve ourselves, but it is often difficult to stay focused with all the clutter that YouTube provides as part of it's service. And the resources provided by the creator are available but often difficult to get to.

Devflix mimics Netflix and provides categories to browse through to easily find the content or provider your looking for on a particular subject. The providers resources are easily located to the right of the video, where you can also take your own notes.

<br><hr>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
